## Usage

- Click on "Gist Sync - Send" to send your workspaces to Gist.
- Click on "Gist Sync - Receive" to get your workspaces from Gist.

> Note that currently using the same Gist on more than one computer can result in problems. When the "Receive" button is pressed, all remote content is combined with local content by Insomnia.
